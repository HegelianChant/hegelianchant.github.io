	The album I've been working on is taking much longer than expected. I'm also very excited (and nervous) about being able to share what I've created. 
That said, I'm impatient, so I've decided to realease bits and scraps of material in the meantime. Hopefully these unfinished audio odds and ends will be 
enjoyable and perhaps give some insight into how I create music. These will all be freely avaiable to stream and download.

	In the meantime, sign up to the email list for updates. They'll be few and far between, so don't worry about me spamming your inbox.

Best,
